Proposal:
We would like to explore any links between social media buzz and sneaker resale data focusing on Yeezy sneakers from mid 2017-2018. We have a sample of Yeezy shoe sales data from a resell website, StockX.com, that has provided 8 variables that we will use to answer our questions regarding correlations between value of sneaker and it’s resell price. We will also use various data from social media platforms to research whether or not social impressions impact the potential resell of our sneaker. We will be using social platforms to observe social media engagement and consumer insight to see if there is any correlation to resales.

The kinds of questions you’ll be asking of that data: -Is there a correlation between social media influence and sneaker resell value? -Is there a correlation between resell value and shoe size? -Is there a correlation between resell value and color way? -Is there a correlation between social impressions and resell value or velocity of buy?

Description of Data    
"The data in this sheet consist of a random sample of all U.S. Off-White x Nike and Yeezy 350 sales from between 9/1/2017 and 2/13/2019. 

To create this sample, we took a random, fixed percentage of StockX sales (X%) for each colorway, on each day, since September, 2017. So, for each day the Off-White Jordan 1 was on the market, we randomly selected X% of its sale from each day. (It’s not important to know what X is; all that matters is that it’s a random sample, and that the same fixed X% of sales was selected from every day, for every sneaker). The sample was limited to U.S. sales only.

We’ve included 8 variables for you to work with: Order Date, Brand, Sneaker Name, Sale Price ($), Retail Price ($), Release Date, Shoe Size, and Buyer Region (the state the buyer shipped to).
